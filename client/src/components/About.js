                <p className='aboutP'>Welcome to Trickster, the ultimate web-based Halloween-oriented app. With Trickster, you can immerse yourself in the spirit of Halloween by maintaining a comprehensive list of blocks in your neighborhood and creating subset lists of locations within each block. Whether you're a trick-or-treater or a Halloween enthusiast, Trickster has got you covered.</p>
                <p className='aboutP'>Trickster allows you to make personalized notes about each location, capturing essential details about their level of participation in Halloween festivities. From identifying whether a location is a residence or a business, to documenting if they hand out candy and the quality of treats they offer, Trickster empowers you to keep track of everything. You can even mark if a location is deserving of a "trick" for their lack of Halloween spirit. Stay organized by tracking which locations have been trick-or-treated, and if a trick has been played on them yet. Plus, don't miss out on the daily Halloween-themed game, adding an extra touch of excitement to your Halloween experience. Get ready to unleash the mischievous side of Halloween with Trickster!</p>
